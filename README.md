# TCM_Herbs_Classification
<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has long relied on herbal prescriptions for treating various health conditions based on patient symptoms. This study presents a novel approach to automate the classification of TCM herb prescriptions by leveraging patient symptoms. The dataset encompasses records from over 800 patients, containing information about their symptoms, diagnoses, and prescribed herbal treatments. To accomplish this, the text data underwent comprehensive preprocessing steps, including tokenization and Word2Vec-based embedding generation tailored to TCM specifics. Features were then selected and categorized for each herb to serve as input for the classification models. Random Forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score to gauge their performance. The results demonstrate promising accuracy and F1-scores across different herbs, showcasing the potential for automated classification of TCM prescriptions. Additionally, the study compares binary features with contextual word embeddings, highlighting the advantage of leveraging context-rich embeddings for improved classification accuracy. These findings underscore the potential of utilizing machine learning models to assist in TCM prescription generation based on patient symptoms.
